# ShortHandTextClassifier
A Binary Machine Learning model that can tell you whether a word is the short hand version of another word. This Machine learning model can help with scanning reciepts for a predifined list of words, or better translation, and many other uses. The current model has reached a 96 percent accuracy, you can find the dataset, the jupyter notebook used for training, and all the checkpoints of models + the final model in the git hub repository.

## Use Cases

A short hand text classifier like this can be very useful when it comes to natrual language processing tasks, or other use applications like
- A Recipet Scanning app that tracks what users buy
- A Better text translation system
- Improving Grammar Correction systems although, they are already very good and etc.
